 * DB_NAME: name of the database. please note: database and database table are not the same thing
 * DB_USER: user for your database. the user needs to have rights for SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE and INSERT.
 *          by the way, it's bad style to use "root", but for development it will work.
 * DB_PASS: the password of the above user

 * For local development .127.0.0.1 or .localhost is fine, but when deploying you should
 * change this to your real domain, like '.mydomain.com' ! The leading dot makes the cookie available for
 * sub-domains too.

/**
 * Configuration for: Hashing strength
 * This is the place where you define the strength of your password hashing/salting
 *
 * To make password encryption very safe and future-proof, the PHP 5.5 hashing/salting functions
 * come with a clever so called COST FACTOR. This number defines the base-2 logarithm of the rounds of hashing,
 * something like 2^12 if your cost factor is 12. By the way, 2^12 would be 4096 rounds of hashing, doubling the
 * round with each increase of the cost factor and therefore doubling the CPU power it needs.
 * Currently, in 2013, the developers of this functions have chosen a cost factor of 10, which fits most standard
 * server setups. When time goes by and server power becomes much more powerful, it might be useful to increase
 * the cost factor, to make the password hashing one step more secure. Have a look here
 * (@see https://github.com/panique/php-login/wiki/Which-hashing-&-salting-algorithm-should-be-used-%3F)
 * in the BLOWFISH benchmark table to get an idea how this factor behaves. For most people this is irrelevant,
 * but after some years this might be very very useful to keep the encryption of your database up to date.
 *
 * Remember: Every time a user registers or tries to log in (!) this calculation will be done.
 * Don't change this if you don't know what you do.
 *
 * To get more information about the best cost factor please have a look here
 * @see http://stackoverflow.com/q/4443476/1114320
 *
 * This constant will be used in the login and the registration class.
